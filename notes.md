All my notes while I try to get this horrible code working


671 home page- format
https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=2DOT671&title=2.671+Home

2nd kind of weird home page format
https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/display/ILAB2


3rd thing - some pages have IDs? Not clear what the link between spaces, IDs and such IDs

https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=288129246


//"space_key": "2DOT671",
    //"start_page": "2.671+Home",
